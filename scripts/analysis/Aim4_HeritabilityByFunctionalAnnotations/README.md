# Aim4_HeritabilityByFunctionalAnnotations

This folder contains code to concatenate existing annotated GZ files from prior partitioned heritability analyses of EUR and EAS, use concatenated GZ files to obtained partitioned LD scores for each ancestry, and estimate the partitioned heritability for each functional annotation for each ancestry and plot the results.
